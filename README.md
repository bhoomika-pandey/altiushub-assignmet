Develop programs to interact with the following questionnaires. Utilize Fake Rest API online servers to simulate test scenarios. If unavailable, you can use https://fakestoreapi.com/docs. Select any record with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints to perform create, update, and delete operations.

Create a function called fakeDataGenerator that generates and returns random fake data for the specified endpoint.
Write a set of Success Tests for each GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoint. Ensure that you use your fakeDataGenerator function to create and update request payloads.

For running the code-
1. npm install axios
2. npm install faker
3. node testAPI.js
